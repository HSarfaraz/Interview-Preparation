#### Sample Answer:

-	I focus too much on details when carrying out tasks:

#### Answer: 
I am a detailed oriented person but when a project has tight deadline, this is not always helpful, I am trying to be more mindful in the situations like this, and I am learning on focusing on the end goal of the task, what I am responsible for.

-	I find difficult to ask people when I needed the help:
  
#### Sample Answer:
I take great pride in my work, When I encounter problem, I always try to figure out things myself, However I do understand, It would be more beneficial to seek advice from other more experience people in the team, so I am taking steps to improve in this area.

-	I Struggle to let go the projects:

#### Sample Answer:
I would like to say, I engrossed (involved) so much in the project, when I am work- ing on them, and I don’t want to let them go. However, I do understand, this is not always helpful to my employer’s goal and I am learning to finish a project and move straight on the next one.

-	I am not good at giving people feedback
#### Sample Answer: 
If someone ask me the feedback, I would rather avoid it, as I don’t want to hurt their feeling. However, I do feel that, feedback is an important part of self-development. And I have been trying to improve in this area by forcing myself to give people feedback, when it is requested.

-	I find it really hard, to say no to people

#### Sample Answer:
-   This has been problem of mine, because I always say yes to everything, Even I don’t have the capacity to do so. Now in the past, I have sometimes become overwhelmed by taking on too many responsibilities, now before I say, yes to things, now I take my time to asses my own workload to make sure, I do have the capacity to the extra work responsi- bilities.

-   Sometimes, I can be too judgmental on others
  
#### Sample Answer: 
In my last role, I would automatically judge people if they were either late finishing a project or if their standard of work was not up to scratch. However, I am trying to improve in this area, and I am no longer jump to conclusion related to other people’s performance. Instead, I try to offer my support or help so they can improve which ultimately serve to help the team to move forward.

-   I don’t have any leadership experience
  
#### Sample Answer: 
I don’t have leadership skill; however, this is something I really want to improve upon. If you ask me now to lead on something, I wouldn’t feel confidant doing so. However, to improve in this area I would seek to observe how managers and team leaders tackle pro- jects and tasks so then I can learn to do it by myself when the opportunity present to itself.

#### Sample Answer: 

I get stressed, if the project run over the deadlines, because I take pride in my work and I genuinely don’t want my employer down, However, I am learning to remain calm in difficult situations such as these and to focus on what I can do to help the project to fin- ish on time and to the necessary standard

## 6. Tell me about a time you had to overcome a difficult problem.

### <img src="tip.png" width="30" align="left"/> Tips 
Hiring managers want to know that you can navigate the typical disagreements that can occur at
work. It’s also a way to gauge your interpersonal skills and self-reliance.

#### Sample Answer: Not found

## Tell me about a time you experienced conflict with a co-worker and how you resolved it?

#### Sample Answer:

-  “While in my current job, I was part of a project team that was tasked with coming up with a new campaign for a client. A coworker and I didn’t see eye-to-eye on the direction the campaign should take when it came to the tone, leading to some conflict.
-  “To address the issue, I requested a meeting with my coworker to discuss their perspec- tive. My goal was to understand why they were adamant about that approach, asking clarifying questions and rephrasing what they shared to ensure I saw the complete pic- ture.
-  “Then, I did the same, sharing my perspective in a calm, professional manner. This led us to a very beneficial discussion, one where we both saw the merits in the other’s strategy. Ultimately, this allowed us to work together to create the best possible campaign, one that boosted the client’s sales by 15 percent.”

## Tell me about a time you disagreed with your boss?

#### Sample Answer:

When people work together, there are several cases of dissent. I experienced a similar dissent while working with my previous employer. My boss was a bit arrogant and high-handed who wanted everything to move as per his style. There was a bug in the software and I had sug- gested a plan to remove it, but he ignored me and rather implemented his own amends, which considerably failed. Then, he called me and I removed the bug. In the entire episode, I was calm and composed, rather than losing my temper.

## Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive?
 
### Keep in mind:

-   Make it easy for the person to give you a quick answer.
-   Schedule time on their calendar.
-   Propose a course of action you’ll take if you don’t hear back.
-   Try a different method of communication.
-   Ask the person directly how you should handle it.

#### Sample Answer:
 
“I can think back to a time when I was working closely with an external partner on planning an event. I was trying to set the schedule for my team, however, it would sometimes take two weeks before the external partner would email me back. I could definitely empathize with this as I know they mentioned they were managing multiple events, however, I also had to recog- nize that it was slowing down the planning for my team. What I did was first I would set a re- minder for myself to follow up to my initial emails two days after I sent my first email. Next, I determined setting up phone meetings might help the external partner communicate more information at once. This really helped in our ability to meet the deadlines we each needed.”

## Tell me about a time you made a mistake?

#### Sample Answer:

I made a mistake in my last job, where I thought a meeting was a simple team meeting but it was actually a meeting with one of our top clients. I was able to quickly recover and gather the info I needed on my laptop, in the meeting, but it would have been less stressful if I had prepared ahead of time. I learned a valuable lesson to double-check calendar appointments and always be sure I know the details of a meeting before going in.

## Tell me about a time when you had to make an important decision with lim-ited information?

#### Sample Answer:

-   I had a hard deadline of noon on a Monday, by which I had to submit a grant application on behalf of my boss, who was out of town. We had worked all weekend making sure every piece of the application was in place, but somehow, we had both overlooked a key component. My boss was flying and would thus be unable to communicate until after the application was due.
-   The information required was something that could best be provided by my boss; how- ever, by comparing previous applications and verifying the details with the department’s business office, I was able to put together the relevant information and made the decision to submit the application before the deadline. It was accepted, and we won the grant.

## Tell me about a time, when don’t see eye-to-eye with your work colleague?

#### Sample Answer:

"Another project manager and I were assigned a project together. I quickly saw my col- league handled follow-up and communication with the client differently than I did. I like to follow-up often and chat on the phone at various stages of the process with the client, but my colleague didn't see the purpose in communicating with the client so frequently. Even- tually, I talked with my coworker about her follow-up style versus mine. We compromised and agreed to follow up with the client every two weeks, rather than every week, to make collaboration smoother. I was glad I approached the situation head-on, and also under- stood and appreciated that my colleague had a different work approach."

## Tell me about a time when you managed to find a simple solution to a com-plex problem?

#### Sample Answer:

I remember such a situation from my job. Facing a tricky app development task, a team of developers were stuck at one point. They were just adding new layers to the code, mak- ing the entire app more robust and complex, which isn’t the worst thing, but such an app is prone to bugs and issues, and once something gets wrong it is harder to troubleshoot it. I was overseeing the project, and I was worried. At the end of the day I knew we had to make things differently, unless we wanted to miss the deadline. And so I spent two days talking to other engineers, brainstorming ideas. Eventually I came with a simple worka- round, using a functionality of an already existing app of one of our business partners, which allowed us to simplify the code of our own app, and move to the next stage of the development. It was just one of these situations when we tried to reinvent the wheel… It took me some time to realize it, and I was the only one in the team to see it, but I did see it and solved this complex issue with a simple solution. 

## Tell me about a time when you failed at work?
Hiring managers can see how you handle mistakes and recover from failures. Plus, they can assess your honesty, accountability, and self-awareness.

#### Answer:
-   “In my first job, I had trouble gauging my workload. After getting my first big solo project, I underestimated the time it would take to complete the work and handle my other du- ties. As a result, I gave the client a deadline that was ultimately unrealistic, and I wasn’t able to deliver in time.
-   “The client was understandably displeased when I informed them that the project would be late. I made sure to take full responsibility for the issue and worked with them to en- sure the project was completed to their satisfaction, albeit behind schedule.
-   “In the end, they were pleased with the results. However, the moment when I had to in- form them that the deadline would be missed stuck with me. It became a powerful lesson for me about time estimates and workload assessments. I used what I learned to improve my approach and, since that project, have finished every project either on time or early.”

## ## Tell me about a time when your style of communication resulted in a posi-tive outcome?

#### Sample Answer:

"My ability to effectively communicate has played a large role in my success as a web devel- oper. Regularly working with other team members and listening to the employees I oversee has allowed me to continuously motivate myself and improve overall performance. Through regular communication and a dedication to ensuring myself is happy and understand my role, which has improved my productivity."

## Tell me about a time when you had to persuade someone to see your point of view?

#### Sample Answer:
 
“Well, to be honest, my biggest battle was to persuade myself, to have confidence in my abilities. I’ve had my share of problems in the past, and most people around me told me I was no good for anything. My confidence suffered, and I was very shy in rela- tionships. But I decided I had to change things. I took the initiative, started reading mo- tivation books, visited psychologist, and joined a sports club–to learn to have
 
interactions with people again. All of this happened three years ago, and now, looking back, I can hardly recognize my old self… I definitely succeeded in persuading myself of my own worth. If I didn’t succeed, I would not sit here today with you, interviewing for a great job.”

## Tell me about a time when you were flexible at work?

### Keep in mind:
An employer might ask you this question to see how you adapt to different situations. Many employers are looking for team members who can adjust to new situations and think crea- tively when solving problems.

#### Sample Answer:
"I showed flexibility in my accounting position when I had a team member leave suddenly. My manager asked me to take over my colleague's clients with only a few days' notice. I stayed late that week, prepping as much information as I could. I also reached out to the new clients and explained I would now work with them. With this preparation, I completed all records for my clients, existing and new, accurately and on time."

## Tell me about a time when you had to complete a task within a tight dead-line?

#### Sample Answer:
In my previous position as a web developer, I often assisted in task submission using some POC. These had tight submission deadlines that required proper time management and com- munication to complete. For example, one of my tasks was to prepare UI page with complex functionality. This required coordination with researchers, gathering data and including visu- als such as charts and graphs. While preparing a POC, I learned how to optimize my time and meet deadlines by using project management tools to ensure my presentation was timely and that I included ever required.
I also wrote to-do lists to track my tasks and make it easier to prioritize what required com- pletion within a certain amount of time. Setting aside a specific amount of time for the parts of the presentation I knew would take a longer time to complete, such as data collection and analysis, I found that this helped me meet deadlines faster and earn more favorable feedback on the information in my presentations.

## Tell me a time when you managed multiple tasks all at once?

#### Sample Answer:
 
I prefer to handle one project at a time. It allows me to focus on the task at hand. However, in business, while that would be ideal, the reality is that I need to be able to adjust to out- side forces. When a lot of things come at me at once, I create a checklist, which helps me to prioritize and guides me to work on the most pressing needs first.

## Tell me a time when you went above and beyond for a customer or a client?

#### Sample Answer:

In my last company, my colleague used to have a hard time on getting started on project. He often called me or one of the other team members to his office to help him. So, I offered to arrive half an hour earlier every day and give him some lessons. He was thrilled. It was amazing how quickly he learned. After a month, he was able to handle almost all tasks with- out any help.

## Tell me a time you had to work with a difficult co-worker?

#### Sample Answer:

"I had a coworker who was never able to finish his work on time. We worked in a really busy office, and the demands were heavy on all of us. His continued delays meant that I often had to pick up the slack, working harder and later to cover for him.
He was always really grateful, but I felt like it was getting out of hand after a couple of months. I said I had to have a proper conversation with him about the situation and think about how we could solve it once and for all.
We met in a neutral place and broke down the issue; I tried to listen and look for solution points. In the end, it became clear that he was signing up for more work than his job descrip- tion had actually specified - and he agreed that a frank conversation with his manager was needed to clarify expectations."

## Tell me about a time when you overcame a difficult challenge at work?

#### Sample Answer:

One of the biggest work challenges I’ve overcome happened at my last job. Two team members were let go and I was left with the workload of three people. I fell behind and knew I couldn’t keep up in the long term, so I asked my manager for help. We came up with a solution that involved hiring, getting temporary help from another team, and streamlining our team’s processes to be more efficient, too. The experience taught me a lot in terms of communication and problem solving, and I think I’m even better prepared for the next problem or challenge I’ll face since I overcame that previous obstacle despite it feeling hopeless initially.

## If your manager assigned you a task that you had never done before, how would you approach it?
 
#### Sample Answer:
'As a web developer, my manager asked me to do a POC on new framework. This was my first such assignment. I informed my manager that I was willing to learn and give it my best shot. I started by reviewing the basics of framework research that I had read online but never ap- plied.
I also took a short-term course online on how to perform basic POC. By the end of the week, I had an in-depth report ready and a deeper understanding of different framework methodolo- gies. This impressed my manager and eventually, I got appreciable for the same.'

In the last organization that I was a part of, the leadership team was always making changes in an effort to improve the quality of the service we provided, but it didn’t seem like the changes stuck around for very long. There was no follow up and the employees would just revert back to doing things how they originally were. My sug- gestion was to implement a change binder to keep track of these plans, which would make it easy to check on which ones worked and which didn’t, and help ensure the changes were implemented each week. With the binder, the results were clearer, and the more successful adjustments became standard policy that all employees followed.
 
## Tell me about a time when you had to overcome a setback?

### Keep in mind
-  The role you'are applying for requires you to overcome challenging problems. If you've never experienced a challenging problem before, the interviewer can't be sure you will be a good fit for their team.
-  The interviewer wants to assess what your approach is when dealing with challenging problems. Are you the type of person who passes the problem on to someone else to deal with, or do you take ownership of the situation, it to gain a thorough understanding of the issue, and then take positive steps to achieve an outcome that is in the best inter- est of the company?

#### Answer:
-   Situation: In my previous role, my manager gave me the important task of organizing a large company conference at local hotel, 20 guests were going to be attending, and I organized everything from the food, the accommodation, the evening entertainment, and the speakers. Unfortunately, four days before the event was due to take place, there was a small fire at the hotel and they could no longer hold the conference.
-   Task: It was task to asses the situation and come up the with a solution to the challenging problem.
-   Action: The easy thing to do would be to reschedule the conference but I wasn’t prepared to do that, I started out by calling alternative venues in the local area. And concise in my requirements, after an hour, I managed to find a suitable alternative venue in a similar are that could cater for our needs. Finally, I emailed all attendees with the new venue instructions, and I then called each and every one of them personally to make sure they were fully aware of the change of venue.
Result: By Remaining calm, by assessing my options, and by being resilient in the face of a difficult challenge I was able to deliver the best.

## Tell me about a time when you made the right decision?

-  When we first started working with him, he was great to work with, he was responsive, and he was respectful of our prices.
-  However, as time went on, he started to complain that our prices were too high, and he was becoming increasingly demanding and difficult to work with.
-  In the end, I had to decide to stop working with him because the profitability we were seeing through the work he put our way was minimal compared with the resources and time we had to put in.
-  l informed the client of our decision to stop working with him in a professional and respectful manner, and whilst he was disappointed, I knew this was the right thing to do for the business.”

## Tell me about a time when you had to lead a team of people ?

#### Keep in mind:
-  Within any management or leadership role, you must be the person who takes the lead. If you haven’t demonstrated leadership skills before, how do you know you can do the job properly?
-  The interviewer wants to hear how you took control of a situation, and you made a deci- sion that had a positive impact on your team or the organization.

### <img src="tip.png" width="30" align="left"/> Tips
Good examples of demonstrating leadership include:
-  Turning around an unperforming team.
-  Getting a difficult project over the finishing line.
-  Coming up with innovative ideas to help a business grow.
-  Giving member of your team feedback to help them improve and develop.
  
#### Sample Answer:

-  SITUATION: When I first started work in my previous role, I carried out an observational assessment of my team's strengths and weaknesses. I quickly noticed that several people in the team were weak at website performance. They weren't paying enough attention to performance and I felt they needed to improve.
-  TASK: It was my responsibility as their leader to ensure they received the right training which would then enable them to do their jobs properly.
-  ACTION: I spoke to each team member individually to explain where I felt they needed to improve and the reasons why. I then enrolled all of them onto a performance skills train- ing course which they needed to complete within a 14-day period.
-  RESULT: At the end of the course, all the team members had improved their perfor- mance skills significantly and this showed in their level of attention towards perfor- mance, and the fact that revenues started to grow due to the improved customer satis-
faction ratings and the increase in online reviews we were receiving

OR

-  SITUATION: When I first took over the leadership of a previous team, there was no struc- ture in place as to how tasks were completed. Although projects were often completed to the right standard, there were no timelines to work towards and nobody had specific re- sponsibility for tasks.
-  TASK: As a responsible leader, I knew this needed to change and so I started putting sys- tems in place that everyone in the team would need to follow.
-  ACTION: I started off by holding a team meeting to explain my vision and how it would work. The team were initially against my ideas because they felt there was nothing wrong with the way they were currently working. “If it isn’t broke, why fix it?” seemed to be the feedback I was getting!
-  I explained to them the benefits of having a systematic approach to tasks and I provided
numerous examples of how a team can significantly improve their performance and out- put by working to a set system! After a bit of debate and persuasion, they agreed it was a great idea. We then brainstormed some ideas as a team before putting multiple systems in place that everyone was now going to work towards moving forward.
-  RESULT: Three months down the line and the output of the team had creased so much that we were able to take on more projects and tasks for the company. We became one of the best performing departments in the organization later that year which I put solely
down to the fact that we started using tried and tested systems.

## Tell me about a time when you had multiple options for solving a difficult problem?

### <img src="tip.png" width="30" align="left"/> Tips
-  Give a previous difficult work situation you were in that demonstrates you are a DETER- MINED, positive and resilient person.
-  In your answer, show you are someone, who always puts the needs of you team first.
-  Show you are not afraid to tackle difficult situations professionally.

#### Answer 1:

“When I first started work in a previous role, I was taking part in a team meet-ing. One of the more senior members of the team kept dismissing my ideas and my suggestions. Every time I put forward an idea, he dismissed it, which I found uncomfortable. During the meeting he did this on no fewer than three separate occasions, so I de-cided to tackle it. It was a difficult situation because I am the type of person who doesn''t like conflict, but I was determined to make sure my ideas and suggestions were listened to. I spoke to my work colleague in private after the meeting and I gave him exam-ples of where he was dismissing my suggestions. I asked him why he felt the need to do this. He was taken aback by my comments and he apologized straight away before ensuring me it wouldn't happen again From that day onwards, I felt more involved in the team meetings, and I actually ended up becoming good friends with my work colleague in and out of the work

#### Answer 2:

“I was working as part of a team on an important project for a client and we had a strict deadline to work towards. Part way through the project the client started making changes to the project specifi-cation which could potentially push back the project finishing time. This was a difficult situation to be in because it was going to be hard for us to implement the requested changes and still finish the project on time.

I decided to speak to the client to negotiate a longer project finishing time. I ex-plained how it was important to maintain high standards whilst working on the pro-ject, and to achieve our objectives we would need an additional 7-days. The client appreciated my honesty and the explanation I gave for the increased deadline, and he agreed to the project extension.”

## Tell me about a time when you received criticism that you thought was un-fair.

### <img src="tip.png" width="30" align="left"/> Tips
The interviewer wants to see if you are somebody who accepts feedback from others, because if you do, you will be the type of person who will continually grow and improve within in their team.
-  Say that you view criticism as a positive thing, and an opportunity for you to improve.
-  Show an understanding in your answer of how important criticism and feedback are to your personal development.
-  Give the interviewer one example of when you have taken onboard feedback previously from someone.
####Keep in mind
The employer clearly wants to hire someone who is prepared to accept constructive criticism in a mature and open way. Anybody who reacts negatively to criticism will not be a good for the team.
Those employees who view constructive criticism as helpful are more likely to be high achiev- ers. Therefore, if you are not prepared to seek ways to use criticism to your advantage, you won’t get hired.
-  Tell the interviewer you are always OPEN TO CONSTRUCUTIVE CRITICISM because you view it as an opportunity for you to learn and improve.
-  In your answer to the ‘how do you respond to criticism’ interview question, tell the interviewer that you view criticism as feedback.
-  Is to make sure you demonstrate in your answer that you always EVALUATE the criticism be- fore acknowledging your faults and weaknesses and taking action to improve.

#### Sample Answer:

“l view criticism as an opportunity for me to improve, develop, and to grow within the team I am a part of.
If someone criticizes my work, I will not take it personally but instead, I will ‘see what I can do
to change things so that my performance improves.
If you view criticism as a negative thing, you will always stay stuck in the same position, which isn't a good thing.

For example, in my previous role, my manager gave me some great feedback about How I was dealing with customers on the telephone. She said | was spending too much time be- ing pleasant with the customers and asking them how their day was when I should have been trying to work through as many customers as possible. I immediately took onboard her feedback and changed the way that I dealt with our customers.”
-  I always respond to criticism with professionalism with an open mind with the attitude that there is always room for improvement. So, when someone criticizes my work, I will listen carefully to what they have to say I will be polite and thankful for their comment and then I will evaluate what their intentions are and how can I use feedback to im- prove so I never take criticism personally because I am that type of employee who al- ways my faults and weaknesses and I will always take positive actions to improve.

## Situational Interview 7 Questions

## Tell me about a time you had to collaborate with a coworker who was difficult to work with?

#### Answer:
"(Problem) I had to work with another programmer who complained a lot about our projects.
(Solution) I took the time to learn about his personal life. It turned out he was going through a tough divorce. Once I got to know him, he was actually a great coworker.
(Benefit to employer) We worked so well together after that we were the most efficient program- ming pair in the company.

## Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for work?

#### Answer:
" In my last company, my colleague used to have a hard time on getting started on project. He often called me or one of the other team members to his office to help him. So, I offered to arrive half an hour earlier every day and give him some lessons. He was thrilled. It was amazing how quickly he learned. After a month, he was able to handle almost all tasks without any help.

## Tell me about a time you had to choose something else over doing a good job

#### Answer:
"I broke my leg skiing and had to miss two weeks of work. I take it easy on the groomers now. I’m happy to report I haven’t missed a day of work in five years.”

## Describe a situation where you weren’t satisfied with your job. What could have made it better?

#### Answer:
“In my last job, our CEO gave me a chance to interview and hire entry-level people for our team. I chose to hire someone who seemed to have a lot of potential but also had some “red flags” or things that wor- ried me. It ended up being a big mistake. They had a poor attitude and dragged the team down until my CEO had to fire them. I learned to be more careful and not rush my decisions and to speak with others on my team who have more experience if I’m unsure of something. I also realized how important each hiring decision is, which made me a better manager in the last few years of my career. Since then, I’ve hired eight new people and never had a bad experience like this again. But it was a great lesson to learn early in my career.”

## Tell me about a time you reached a big goal at work. How did you reach it?

#### Answer:
" In my recent job, I set a personal goal to not only accomplish my set objectives for my job, but also to develop proficiency in a new tool or technology. My objectives for my job were both completed and I was also able to develop proficiency in React, which I had previously only used in POC. Let me tell you about the objectives achieved and where I was able to use React to complete the project.”

## Describe a situation where you saw a problem and took steps to fix it?

#### Sample Answer:
"If I notice at any point during a project that there are any errors in the teamwork or an issue arises as a result of miscommunication, I address it immediately. I always first try to reach the core of the issue and analyze the circumstances that created it. This way I make sure I thoroughly understand what I’m up against so that I can make an effective and efficient plan of action.

Once I identify the problem, I will try to track the points that were the basis of the issue. If the issue can be traced back to a specific team member, I would talk to this person to discuss the situation, how it came about, and how I can provide support to make sure we tackle this challenge together.

Also, if needed, I would encourage this team member to take responsibility for his or her actions, the same as I would do in a similar situation. In these cases, it’s essential to show empathy, improve work pro- cesses, and communication. I also use these opportunities to strengthen the relationship between my col- leagues and me as well.”

“One of the staff members at my previous company started coming into work late. I'd just ad- vanced to a management role, so the employee was under my supervision. I approached her and explained to her my concerns. I provided feedback to discuss the company's policies and how her actions were reflecting on her work ethic. This was difficult to discuss, as the employee was usu- ally an enthusiastic and motivated team member.
However, I felt that being direct and communicating openly was the best approach to giving this employee feedback. During our discussion, the employee explained they'd recently taken custody of a family member, making caregiving challenging during the week. We came up with solutions to the employee's issues, which I believe never would have happened had I not provided con- structive feedback.”

## Values Interview 4 Questions

Interviews are an opportunity for you to describe the skills, education, experience and personality traits that make you a good match for an organization. Your answers can show employers that you have the qualities that make you a strong candidate for the role. You might face questions about honesty, integrity, teamwork and trustworthiness.

## Tell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma at work and how you han-dled it?

### Keep in mind:
Interviewers may ask this question to see how you respond to moral and ethical issues in the work- place. These can be uncomfortable situations, and they want to know that you are willing to do what's right even when it's hard. You should discuss a situation that shows your integrity and honesty with- out demeaning another person.

#### Answer:
"I used to go to lunch with the same group of coworkers three to four times a week. After a while, I noticed that one coworker did not go with us to clock out and clock back in. I didn't want to assume anything, so the next time we went to lunch, I reminded my coworker to clock out. They told me they didn't really worry about clocking out for lunch. The next day, I had to let my manager know."

## How do you define integrity in the workplace?

### Keep in mind:
Interviewers want to know how you approach doing what's right at work. They want to make sure that your views align with their expectations in areas like honesty, trust and reliability. In your answer, ex- plain that doing the right thing is important to you in all settings. Discuss how important your values are and the steps you take to make ethical choices.

#### Answer:
"I define integrity as maintaining your own moral code, no matter who's around. It's about doing things the right way, honoring your word and being a hard worker because that's what you should do, not because of external accolades. I try to make sure my actions are in line with my personal beliefs, and if I see something that goes against my values or the company's standards, I know to report it."

## Have you ever had to work with a difficult coworker? How did you handle it?

### Keep in mind:
Interviewer may ask about challenging personalities in the workplace to see how you manage tension and interpersonal conflict. These issues can be distracting and affect the entire office, so it's important to make sure candidates can get along with others and maintain a peaceful environment. In your an- swer, explain how you approach disagreements and discuss a situation where you dealt with a conflict successfully.

#### Sample Answer:
"When coworkers seem difficult, I start by listening. Many apparent conflicts are simply the result of misunderstandings. Once I can identify what the problem really is, then I try to work toward a solution that benefits everyone.
For example, I had a coworker who told our boss that I wasn't including their name on team projects. When my boss asked me about this, I explained that I always used the last page of our reports to list the team members. My coworker had not seen this page, and once I showed them, we resolved the issue quickly. I agreed to put the team page at the beginning of our reports going forward."

## How do you approach team projects?

### Keep in mind:

Employers ask about how you work with others to make sure you can be a team player. They know that teamwork and collaboration are drivers of innovation and productivity. A cohesive staff can cre- ate a positive, comfortable atmosphere. Your answer should explain what is most important to you when working in a group and what strategies you employ to make the process enjoyable and effec- tive.

#### Answer:
"I like working on teams because it's a great opportunity to hear other perspectives and learn from my peers. It's helpful to review the project's scope, timeline and goals before getting started so that everyone understands the details. I approach team projects as both a student and a teacher. I want to hear everyone's ideas, and I also want to share what I know to help create the best possible outcome."

## Describe a time you solved a problem in a nontraditional way?

### Keep in mind:
Managers appreciate innovation and creativity, which can help propel their businesses forward. These questions allow interviewers to see if you think progressively. Share a time when you came up with a new idea or solution for your business or in your personal life.

#### Answer:
"When I was working as a marketing associate, I took a weekend workshop on social media market- ing. Our company had not used this route historically, so I created a proposal to launch a social media marketing initiative. My manager liked my idea, and I became the Social Media Director for the next two years."

## How do you manage stress on the job?

#### Sample Answer:
-  “While I’ve found that some stress actually pushes me to be my best, it’s also essential to ensure that my stress levels remain reasonable. One approach I’ve found that works for me is focusing on organization.
-  “I’m a big fan of breaking large responsibilities down into small tasks, making them feel more manageable and giving me a roadmap to follow. For a recent project in my current job, I divided the work up into ten micro-goals. Then, I blocked out time on my calendar for every activity. Not only does this keep me on target, but it also reduces the odds that I’ll feel overwhelmed.

## Describe a time when you had to adapt quickly to a change in priorities?

### Keep in mind
Regardless of whether a workplace is fast- or slow-paced, unexpected events can occur. Hiring managers want to know that you can shift gears quickly if the need arises, so they ask questions like this one to assess your agility.

#### Sample Answer:
-  “As a member of my current employer’s IT department, COVID-19 required some quick pivoting. I was part of a team that managed remote work permissions and technologies for the organiza- tion. When it became clear that a shelter-in-place order may be on the horizon, we had to repri- oritize quickly, ensuring we could get everyone their needed credentials, applications, and de- vices handled as fast as possible.
-  “I spoke with my manager about my workload, allowing us to identify tasks that could be set
aside temporarily. After that, prioritized the employee list based on their position, ensuring
those who needed to stay connected were handled before those where a short delay wouldn’t
be as problematic.
-  “Then, I dedicated as much time and effort to setting up telecommuting solutions as possible.
This includes everything from ordering mobile devices and laptops, coordinating the service providers to add relevant user accounts, and creating initial training documents to ensure those who began working remotely had the information they needed to transition as seamlessly as possible. While the situation was challenging, I was able to complete everything tasked to me before a shelter-in-place order was issued in our area, and even had time to assist others, in-
creasing the success of the entire project.”

## Tell me about a time when you led a team ?

### Keep in mind
With this question, the hiring manager is trying to learn more about your leadership skills. Addi- tionally, they might be looking for insights about how you oversee the work of others and keep multiple people on target as they work toward a singular goal.

#### Sample Answer:
“In my last position, I was tasked with overseeing the transition to a new order management system. This involved coordinating with multiple teams to ensure that the date from the existing solution would transi- tion successfully to the new one. Additionally, I had to communicate with all of the end-users, ensuring they knew about use limitations or downtime in advance.
“I created a project plan for the transition and implementation, and worked closely with each team to ensure the timeline was workable. Along the way, I monitored progress, answered questions, and facili- tated conversations to keep everyone on the same page. Additionally, I provided reports to the leadership team, ensuring they were informed.
“Ultimately, the project was a success. All of the transferred data was in place, and we finished on time,
ensuring the company could reach full productivity on the desired schedule.”
