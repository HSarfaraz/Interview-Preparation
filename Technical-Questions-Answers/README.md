HR Call and ask few queries
1. What is your total experience, and different technology?
Answer: Give in brief on call / Email
5
Companies will check mostly 3 things in employee 1. Is he a right fit?
Keep in mind:
a. They are asking you, so that, you can contribute to their business in super-fast time.
b. They don’t want to have to train you for weekend, and they certainly don’t want to have to teach you the skill and qualities to excel in the job role.
c. 7 skills seen by the company
1. Have good communication skills.
2. Collaborating with others as a part of team. Means team first
3. Having a positive attitude, Mean be positive when face the challenges / change.
4. Flexibility, Means work beyond office hours, work outside job description, always be flexible.
5. Goal oriented, Work to achieve the task.
6. Reliability & Trustworthiness, tell how your reliability and trustworthiness will add values to the team.
7. Resourcefulness: Solving problems quickly when they occur.
2. Is candidate passionate about job?
Keep in mind:
The employer may actually want to know about your personal interests since a person’s interests can say a lot about them, but they also want to see how you talk about something when you’re passion-ate about it. If you seem disinterested while talking about something you claim to be passionate about, the employer may think you’re not going to have any enthusiasm for the job either.
Dos and Don’ts
• Do talk about something you’re really passionate about. Making something up will seem disin-genuous.
• Do keep it simple. Name one thing you’re passionate about and share why.
• Don’t talk about something that doesn’t make you seem like a good fit for the job.
• Smile and be yourself while you’re talking about your passion.
• Be aware of how long you’re talking and stay on topic.
• If you don’t have a “passion,” talk about what you’re currently prioritizing in your life.
• Do pick something you’re knowledgeable about.
• Expect follow up questions.
• Don’t share something that is not work appropriate.
Answer:
6
“One thing I’m passionate about is personal development. I try to read at least one book a month that will help me better myself.”
3. Emotional intelligence (EI) is correct?
Keep in mind:
(EI) is your ability to understand your emotions and other's emotions. Your emotional intelligence also supports your ability to respond to others and apply and manage your feelings in different situations. In the workplace, your EI supports teamwork, communication and your ability to contribute to team goals.
Telephone / Technical Round:
Questions asked during a technical interview can fall into several categories including:
1. Educational
2. Situational
3. Technical
4. Behavioral
Technical Interview Questions
Q 1. What programming languages are you familiar with?
Keep in mind:
A software engineer should have experience with a wide range of programming languages. This knowledge is vital to having success in this role. Before your interview, review the job description to see if they mention whether or not you'll need programming language experience for the role. Re-spond with languages you're familiar with that match the employer's needs.
Answer:
7
“I am proficient in React, JavaScript, Typescript. Of these programming languages, I feel most com-fortable working with React. In my previous role, I worked mainly with React to create applications that worked across multiple platforms. I also used Typescript to develop a new ecommerce applica-tion. Using Javascript, I was able to improve my productivity when developing web-based apps and software.” Q 2. Describe the last project you worked on, including any obstacles and your con-tributions to its success?
Keep in mind:
“A question relating to a specific project will help the interviewer better understand your process and how you handle adversity while working on a specific task.”
Answer:
“A previous employer tasked me with creating an internal online learning and training program for employees. The purpose of the program was to make sure all employees received proper training on certain topics, including customer service, compliance with legal requirements and workplace ethics. I began by researching other similar training systems to figure out what worked and what didn't. Next, I used Javascript and bootstrap to code a simple application, which I then used to upload training courses.
After testing the simplified program, I added elements to make it more engaging to employees, such as games and interactive quizzes. This program was well-received by the employees of the organiza-tion, and their customer service success rates increased by 25% after all team members took the re-quired course.”
Q 3. What are your thoughts on declarative vs. imperative paradigms such as func-tional and object-oriented programming?
Keep in mind:
“Programming paradigm” is a broad categorization for languages as either declarative or imperative. However, it is useful to consider these general programming styles rather than concrete language di-rectives. While certain approaches may be cumbersome in some, there are many that are not as rigid. Languages such as JavaScript and Java allow either approach to be taken, even if they lend them-selves toward one approach over another.”
Answer:
“There was a project where we were tasked with reworking the browser client application. It used an imperative, object-oriented approach with many of the custom controls getting much of their func-tionality from a growing inheritance hierarchy. We took this as an opportunity to shift to a more
8
declarative approach. After the conversion, we saw a dramatic decline in state-related bugs as we were no longer manually updating the interface in response to events. This had previously been the most common type of user-reported bug.
We did, however, have to make adjustments in a few key places. In more dynamic, performance-sensi-tive portions of the application, the caching mechanisms we implemented to prevent excessive recal-culation were becoming overly complex. We simplified this by switching back to an imperative ap-proach to updating the component.”
Q 4. What are your most used design patterns and in what contexts do you use them?
Keep in mind:
Similar to the previous question, this probes your knowledge of more abstract, theoretical concepts. Very few people are familiar with all of the formalized software design patterns. In fact, many well-established engineers have a hard time even naming more than a few. After reviewing the topic, you may realize that you leverage many of these patterns daily, even if you aren't aware of the formal name. Reviewing these concepts helps provide a common shorthand, streamlining complex discus-sions.
Answer:
"For gaming projects, my level state and player character are generally implemented as singletons. For enemy creation, I’ll use a factory that will produce differing enemies based on some inputs. Addition-ally, the bullets being fired by the character will be implemented in an object pool to avoid perfor-mance hits from excessive instantiation and garbage collection. If the game is more complex, I may switch to a compositional model such as Entity-Component-System. The system functions would then leverage dependency injection to better separate concerns and increase testability of the game logic."
Q 5. What is “Agile” software development and what are your thoughts on it?
Keep in mind:
Process is an extremely important component of software development. “Agile” is currently one of the most popular software development processes adopted in the industry. The core concepts were intro-duced in 2001 when “The Manifesto for Agile Software Development” was published. Since its incep-tion, growing numbers of companies have adopted the methodologies in some form. However, there are a wide range of opinions and interpretations on the subject. Some invest the time to train for Ag-ile certification while others use the principles as guidelines rather than hard rules, interpreting “Agile” as an adjective rather than a noun. And there are yet others who wholly disagree with the philosophy.
9
No matter your opinion, wide industry adoption means you will likely work within the framework at some point in your career. You should be capable of articulating the details of the process. Try using concrete examples from your experience. In your answer, address areas of the process such as:
▪ What worked about the process?
▪ What did not?
▪ Did your team deviate from the recommendations?
▪ Did that work to your benefit or detriment?
Answer:
"Agile software development is a process that focuses on incremental delivery by the team as a whole. The project is broken up into small chunks that are able to be completed within a given timeframe called ‘sprints.’ In my previous role, we were quite successful in adopting the process. We used two-week sprints and kept high contact with many face-to-face discussions to review questions and con-cerns as they arose.
In addition, we had daily standup meetings to keep everyone synced on team progress. The only ad-justment to the process I would have made was in regard to our standup meetings. The name ‘standup’ refers to literal standing meetings to encourage focus and brevity. However, our meetings tended to transition over into standard status meetings for our team lead rather than remaining a time for our team to sync. Other than this, the process really did facilitate delivering higher quality software on a more predictable timetable."
Q 4. Describe a difficult bug you were tasked with fixing in a large application. How did you debug the issue?
Keep in mind:
Bugs usually appear in new applications and software programs, and it's a software engineer's re-sponsibility to locate and resolve these issues. Difficult bugs are often the result of an unusual align-ment of conditions. Hearing your experience of resolving bugs explores several aspects of your skills including critical thinking and how well you handle stress and pressure.
Answer:
"I received a bug report from our DevOps team about one of our databases being stressed from an expensive query being called excessively from the UI. I first checked the logs to find out when the trouble started. This gave me the rough commit range in which the bug was introduced. I was able to reproduce the bug on the latest piece of code, but only in production. I ran a git bisect to isolate the specific commit that introduced the bug and pulled the branch. However, I was not able to reproduce the issue. I went to the UI to debug using the browser devtools. Sourcemaps are not available in our production environment, so I had to map the minified JavaScript code to the source CoffeeScript code.
10
I was able to determine that the offending method was being called on every page as opposed to the occasional call from a lesser-used specific feature. Diving back into the commit I’d identified earlier, I found no change in reference to the method. The only approximate change I could find was an unre-lated tweak to a line in a file that had a reference to it that had been “commented out” about three years prior. I decided to deploy some distinct logging statements to ensure that I had correctly identi-fied the method. My logging confirmed the connection. After some additional rounds of logging, I was able to identify an unfortunate bug in CoffeeScript in which the code that had been “commented out” years earlier was being included in minified production code due to an alignment of the tweak and another piece of code from another developer that had been merged into master minutes be-fore."
Q 4. How do you explain technical challenges to stakeholders who do not have tech-nical knowledge or backgrounds?
Keep in mind:
Businesses form software development teams to solve problems for real people. Being deeply im-mersed in development, it’s easy to forget this. While some engineers may wish to be provided soft-ware requirements and work uninterrupted on a project “until it’s ready,” it’s important to remember that stakeholders in non-technical departments—like customer success and marketing—must plan around the development. Unforeseen obstacles often present themselves in one form or another, re-quiring a conversation on how to best solve the problem. Employers want to know that you are able to clearly communicate these obstacles to non-technical stakeholders, ensuring all parties are fully informed when decisions are made.
Answer:
"When confronted with an obstacle, I don’t feel it is my job to unilaterally alter the project scope or tell stakeholders that something can’t be done. The quality of software is often a matter of balancing scope, cost and time. That balance is a business decision as opposed to a technical one. Rather, I come up with some potential alternatives and present their impact on that balance. For example, if an impediment may significantly push delivery beyond what was projected, I might present an alternative that can meet the current timeline with much of the same scope but will likely diminish the quality and degrade the user experience.
Or, perhaps I’d suggest lowering the priority of certain features related to the obstacle allowing us to deliver some portion of the original feature set in the planned delivery window. This is often the start-ing point of a conversation as the stakeholders begin asking more questions about what can or can’t be done. This collaborative process ensures that all parties are confident in the final decision.”
Q 4. What aspect of our company, product or team interests you most?
11
Keep in mind:
Retention is a high priority for many employers. Replacing a team member can be quite expensive in cost terms of recruitment and training time. Asking questions to ensure your interests and motiva-tions align with that of the company can reduce the risk of losing you as a team member. Though you’re ideally excited by the mission of the company, it is not uncommon for companies to use niche technology specifically to attract higher-quality talent. To answer this question, incorporate details from your research that speak specifically to the company’s values, past projects or a responsibility mentioned in the job description that aligns with your career motivations and progression.
Answer:
"I was watching an interview with your CEO about your product that aims to disrupt the lending in-dustry. Streamlining arduous tasks like loan applications has huge potential. I think the growth in this sector over the last year is a big indication of things to come. Additionally, I’m excited by the un-tapped potential of blockchain technology you have recently decided to incorporate. I see this as giv-ing your company the competitive advantage in this space as the verifiable auditability will reduce compliance costs." Q 4. How do you determine a project’s success?
Keep in mind:
While releasing high-quality software is vital, software that doesn’t address the needs of the user and the business produces little value. Employers want to know that you are thinking beyond the technical aspects and aim to solve real-world problems. This often comes down to identifying a metric to im-prove and creating a testable hypothesis of your expected project impact.
Answer:
"Before a project is even started, success metrics are laid out. I will identify the key performance indi-cator (KPI) that we are hoping to impact and begin gathering information to formulate ideas. These ideas are stated as a falsifiable hypothesis. For example, ‘We believe that reducing checkout steps will increase sales conversion. An increase of 2% will be considered a positive signal.’ This keeps the team focused on the impact of our projects on the business’s bottom line."
Javascript Q How to call an API?
Answer:
There are 4 ways to call API in javascript
1. XML HTTP Request
2. Fetch
12
3. Axios
4. jQuery AJAX
XML HTTP Request
• All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object to request data from a server.
• It works on the oldest browsers as well as on new ones.
• It was deprecated in ES6 but is still widely used. var request = new XMLHttpRequest(); request.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/users/anuradha9712'); request.send(); request.onload = ()=>{ console.log(JSON.parse(request.response)); }
Fetch
• The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network) in an asynchronous manner.
• It returns a Promise
• It is an object which contains a single value either a Response or an Error that occurred.
• .then() tells the program what to do once Promise is completed. fetch('https://api.github.com/users/anuradha9712') .then(response =>{ return response.json(); }).then(data =>{ console.log(data); })
Axios
• It is an open-source library for making HTTP requests.
• It works on both Browsers and Node js
• It can be included in an HTML file by using an external CDN
• It also returns promises like fetch API <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script> axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/anuradha9712') .then(response =>{
13
console.log(response.data) })
jQuery AJAX
• It performs asynchronous HTTP requests.
• Uses $.ajax() method to make the requests. <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script> $(document).ready(function(){ $.ajax({ url: "https://api.github.com/users/anuradha9712", type: "GET", success: function(result){ console.log(result); } }) }) Q What is Event loop? And how callback execute?

Q What is Currying?
Answer:
Currying is a technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments, into sequence of functions with single argument.In other words, when a function, instead of taking all arguments at one time, takes the first one and return a new function that takes the second one and returns a new function which takes the third one, and so forth, until all arguments have been fulfilled.
When to use:
a) It helps to avoid passing same variable again and again.
b) It is extremely useful in event handling.

Q What is Async await?
Answer:
Async/await statements are syntactic sugar created on top of JavaScript Promises. They allow us to write Promise-based code as if it were synchronous, but without blocking the main thread.
Reference
• https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/async-await-javascript-tutorial/
• https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/async-await-function-in-javascript/
Q What is promise?
Answer:
1) JavaScript is a synchronous programming language. But due to callback functions we can make it function like an asynchronous programming language.
2) Promises “saves us from Callback hell”
3) Promises are objects that contain operations to be executed at a later time.
4) A promise in JavaScript is asynchronous, meaning it takes time to resolve or finish.
5) If the promise is successful, the fulfillment callback will be called. If the promise is rejected, the rejected call back will be called instead.
6) A promise is simply a placeholder for an asynchronous task which is yet to be completed. When you define a promise object in your script, instead of returning a value immediately, it returns a promise.
7) we can define a promise in your JavaScript by calling the Promise class and constructing an object like this:
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { resolve('this is the eventual value the promise will return'); }, 300); }); console.log(myPromise);
Running this in the console will return a Promise object:
15
8) A Promise can also be rejected. Most of the time, rejections occur because JS encountered some kind of error while running the Asynchronous code. In such a scenario, it calls the reject() function instead. const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { let a = false; setTimeout(() => { return (a) ? resolve('a is found!'): reject('sorry, no a'); }, 300); });
Q How to Chain Promises with then()
1) When the promise finally returns a value, you will typically want to do something with that return value.
2) For example, if you were making a network request, you might want to access the value and dis-play it on the page for the user.
3) You can define two callback functions which you want to get called when a promise is either ful-filled or rejected. These functions are defined inside a nested then() method: const anotherPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { resolve('this is the eventual value the promise will return'); }, 300); }); // CONTINUATION anotherPromise .then(value => { console.log(value) })
Running this code will display the fulfillment message after three seconds in the console
4) If you are only going to define a single callback function (aka a fulfillment handler) in then(), then you will need to nest a catch() method at the bottom of the promise chain to catch any possible errors. const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { let a = false; setTimeout(() => { return (a) ? resolve('a is found!'): reject('sorry, no a');
16
}, 300); }); myPromise .then(value => { console.log(value) }) .catch(err => { console.log(err) });
5) Since myPromise will eventually resolve to a rejection, the function defined in the nested then() will be ignored. Instead, the error handler in catch() will run

Q What is arrow function? Difference between arrow function and normal func-tion?
1. References:
1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-arrow-function-and-how-to-create-it/
2) https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-arrow-function/
3) https://www.programiz.com/javascript/arrow-function
4) https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/javascript-arrow-function/
1. Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
2. Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax. const hello = () => { console.log("Hello world"); }
3. If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, we can remove the brackets and the return keyword. const helloName = (name) => "Hello " + name;
4. So, Arrow functions lets us write functions even in a single line!
5. If we have one parameter, we can even omit the parentheses that enclose the parameter const helloName = name => "Hello " + name;
6. Both arrow functions and regular functions can be used as object methods.
17
7. Now, let’s see where the differences emerge between the different function declaring and defin-ing methods
1) this binding
a. Regular functions have their own dynamic this binding, while arrow functions do not have their own this.
b. The value of this inside a regular function depends on how the function is invoked.
c. During a simple invocation the value of this equals to the global object (or undefined if the function runs in strict mode) const function fun() { console.log(this); } fun(); // prints global object (window)
d. During a method invocation the value of this is the object owning the method: const obj = { fun() { console.log(this); } }; obj.fun(); // prints obj
…. cc const obj = { fun1(items) { console.log(this); // prints obj const fun2 = () => { console.log(this); // prints obj }; } };
e. this value inside the arrow function fun2() equals to this value of the outer function fun1().
2) arguments object
18
1. Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special array-like object containing the list of arguments with which the myFunction('a', 'b'); // prints { 0: 'a', 1: 'b'}
2. No arguments object is defined inside an arrow function.
3. The arguments object is resolved lexically: the arrow function accesses arguments from the closest outer non-arrow function. function fun1() { const fun2 = () => { console.log(arguments); } fun2('c', 'd'); } fun1('a', 'b'); // prints { 0: 'a', 1: 'b' }
3) new keyword
1. Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible (means that we can use regular functions as constructors) and callable. And since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. function fun(){ console.log("hello"); } const obj = new fun(); //valid code
2. The arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be called with the new keyword. let fun = () => { console.log("hello); } const obj = new fun(): // Gives error
Q Difference between local storage and session storage?
1) “The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or local storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data items.”
2) localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules:
19
a. They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.
b. The values stored may only be strings.
c. They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.
The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
1. localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
2. sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.
3. Usage of local storage and session storage
1. You can access localStorage or sessionStorage, using the window object. myStorage = window.localStorage; myStorage = window.sessionStorage;
2. For both local storage and session storage, you can set, get, remove, and clear items using the appropriate methods.
3. Set
a. The setItem() method takes a key name and a value as arguments. It will then add the key/value pair to the Storage object. If the key already ex-ists, it will update the key’s value. window.localStorage.setItem(keyName, keyValue); window.sessionStorage.setItem(keyName, keyValue);
4. Get
a. The getItem() method takes a key name as an argument. It will return that key’s value. If the key does not exist in the Storage object, it will re-turn null. var aValue = window.localStorage.getItem(keyName); var aValue = window.sessionStorage.getItem(keyName);
5. Remove
a. The removeItem() method takes a key name as an argument. It will re-move that key from the Storage object if it exists. If there is no item as-sociated with the key, it will do nothing. window.localStorage.removeItem(keyName); window.sessionStorage.removeItem(keyName);
6. Clear
20
a. The clear() method will clear all keys stored in the Storage object. window.localStorage.clear(); window.sessionStorage.clear();
7. To check the Storage, right-click on the page and select inspect to open up the Chrome Dev Tools. Or, you can use the shortcut, Cmd + Opt + J.
8. From there, select Application and you will see the Storage section. This section contains the Local Storage and Session Storage tabs. If we open up both of these tabs, we can see the page, http://localhost:3000. Within this tab, we can see the key/value pair table.
Q What is Document?
Answer:
The document object represents your web page. If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.
Q What are Closures?
Answer:
1. A closure is a combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
2. In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner func-tion.
3. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
4. In other words, it’s the fact of putting a function inside of another, which gives the enclosed function access to the outer one’s variables. The term ‘lexical environment’ is referring to the scope of the outer function in this case. function outer(){ let outerVar = "outside"; function inner(){ let innerVar = "inside"; console.log("The outer variable is " + outerVar); } return inner; }
5. In JavaScript, any function that is executed creates a closure by default
6. The inner function has access to the outer function’s variable because it is within its local or lexical scope.
21
1) The inner has access to the outer function’s variable, whereas the latter doesn’t have access to innerVar. Lexical scope is a one-way street only the inner function can ac-cess anything in the outer function.
2) The outer function can only get results (return value, console output, etc) from the inner function by returning it.
3) The outer function can only get results (return value, console output, etc) from the inner function by returning it.
4) The outer function can only get results (return value, console output, etc) from the inner function by returning it.
7. This means that technically it shouldn’t be able to access the outer function’s variables. In many programming languages, all the variables of an outer function would have been de-clared and continued to exist up until the point where the function returns a value (the in-ner function in this case). When a function is called, it creates a call (or execution) stack, which is simply specialized allocated memory space. Each call creates its own execution stack with a set of local variables. In traditional languages like C/C++, for example, calling the inner function would create its own memory stack (see diagram below). Hence, the inner function would not have access to any variables outside of its own scope. However, in JavaS-cript, every function that is executed creates a closure. In other words, every function is cre-ated with the ability to enclose functions inside of it, this enclosure gives their inner func-tions access to all variables within them. Therefore, closure is simply the combination of a function and its lexical scope.
8. Now, let’s say we’d like to return the actual value inside the second function, as opposed to its definition. For that, we could add the following lines of code: let innerOutput = outer(); //Output: [Function: inner] /* Here's what happens behind the scenes after the code above runs: innerOutput = inner */ console.log(innerOutput()) //Same as innerOutput = inner();
22
9. Output: The outer variable is outside
10. In Short:
1) Closure is the fact of enclosing a function within another such that the enclosed func-tion can access the variables outside of its own scope.
2) For every function that is created, JavaScript creates a closure by default.
3) Closures allow for privacy of the variables of the enclosed function
Q What is call, apply and bind methods?
Answer:
1. Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.
2. Apply invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
3. Bind returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.
Apply vs. Call vs. Bind Examples
Call var person1 = {firstName: 'Jon', lastName: 'Kuperman'}; var person2 = {firstName: 'Kelly', lastName: 'King'}; function say(greeting) { console.log(greeting + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName); } say.call(person1, 'Hello'); // Hello Jon Kuperman say.call(person2, 'Hello'); // Hello Kelly King
Apply Sdsd var person1 = {firstName: 'Jon', lastName: 'Kuperman'}; var person2 = {firstName: 'Kelly', lastName: 'King'}; function say(greeting) { console.log(greeting + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName); } say.apply(person1, ['Hello']); // Hello Jon Kuperman say.apply(person2, ['Hello']); // Hello Kelly King
Bind var person1 = {firstName: 'Jon', lastName: 'Kuperman'}; var person2 = {firstName: 'Kelly', lastName: 'King'};
23
function say() { console.log('Hello ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName); } var sayHelloJon = say.bind(person1); var sayHelloKelly = say.bind(person2); sayHelloJon(); // Hello Jon Kuperman sayHelloKelly(); // Hello Kelly King
When To Use Each
1. Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Just decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments.
2. I always remember which one is which by remembering that Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.
3. Bind is a bit different. It returns a new function. Call and Apply execute the current function im-mediately.
4. Bind is great for a lot of things. We can use it to curry functions like in the above example. We can take a simple hello function and turn it into a helloJon or helloKelly. We can also use it for events like onClick where we don’t know when they’ll be fired but we know what context we want them to have.

Q What is Event bubbling & capturing?
Answer:
1. An event listener is basically a function that waits for an event to occur. That event can be anything like a mouse click event, submitting a form, pressing keys of a keyboard, etc.
2. An event listener contains three parameters and it can be defined using the following syntax. <element>.addEventListener(<eventName>,<callbackFunction>, {capture : boolean});
a. <element>: The element to which an event listener is attached.
b. <eventName>: It can be ‘click’,’key up’,’key down’ etc. events.
c. <callbackFunction>: This function fires after the event happened.
d. {capture: boolean}: It tells whether the event will be in the capture phase or in the bubbling phase (optional)
3. With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. Only certain events can bubble. Events that do bub-ble have this property set to true. You can use this property to check if an event is
24
allowed to bubble or not. At present, all the modern browsers have event bubbling as the default way of event flow. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script> <style> div { color: white; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; } h2 { color: black; } #grandparent { background-color: green; width: 300px; height: 300px; } #parent { background-color: blue; width: 200px; height: 200px; } #child { background-color: red; width: 100px; height: 100px; } </style> </head>
25
<body> <div> <h2>Welcome To GFG</h2> <div id="grandparent">GrandParent <div id="parent">Parent <div id="child">Child</div> </div> </div> </div> <script> const grandParent = document.getElementById("grandparent"); const parent = document.getElementById("parent"); const child = document.getElementById("child"); grandParent.addEventListener("click", (e) => { console.log("GrandParent"); }, { capture: false }); parent.addEventListener("click", (e) => { console.log("Parent"); }, { capture: false }); child.addEventListener("click", (e) => { console.log("Child"); }, { capture: false }); </script> </body> </html>
4. The child div lies inside the parent div as well as in the grandparent div. So, when the child div clicked, we indirectly clicked on both parent div and grandparent div. Thus, propagation is moving from inside to outside in the DOM or we can say events are get-ting bubble up.
5. Therefore, the process of propagating from the closest element to the farthest away ele-ment in the DOM (Document Object Modal) is called event bubbling.
6. Event Capturing is the event starts from top element to target element. Modern browser doesn't support event capturing by default but we can achieve that by code in JavaScript. <!DOCTYPE html>
26
<html> <head> <style> div { color: white; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; } h2 { color: black; } #grandparent { background-color: green; width: 300px; height: 300px; } #parent { background-color: blue; width: 200px; height: 200px; } #child { background-color: red; width: 100px; height: 100px; } </style> </head> <body> <div>
27
<h2>Welcome To GFG</h2> <div id="grandparent">GrandParent <div id="parent">Parent <div id="child"> Child</div> </div> </div> </div> <script> const grandParent = document.getElementById("grandparent"); const parent = document.getElementById("parent"); const child = document.getElementById("child"); // Changing value of capture parameter as 'true' grandParent.addEventListener("click", (e) => { console.log("GrandParent"); }, { capture: true }); parent.addEventListener("click", (e) => { console.log("Parent"); }, { capture: true }); child.addEventListener("click", (e) => { console.log("Child"); }, { capture: true }); </script> </body> </html>
7. the ancestor divs of the child div were printing first and then the child div itself. So, the process of propagating from the farthest element to the closest element in the DOM is called event capturing. Both terms are just opposite of each other.
8. Inshort, If {capture: true}, event capturing will occur else event bubbling will occur.
9. Both can be prevented by using the stopPropagation() method.
Q What is prototype in javascript?
Answer:
28
“In JavaScript, every object holds a reference to a superior object from which it inherits its properties. This superior object is called a prototype and this behavior is referred to as prototypal inheritance. The prototypal inheritance happens via a prototype chain.”
JavaScript is a prototype based language, so, whenever we create a function using JavaScript, JavaS-cript engine adds a prototype property inside a function, Prototype property is basically an object (also known as Prototype object), where we can attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
<script> // function constructor function Person(name, job, yearOfBirth){ this.name= name; this.job= job; this.yearOfBirth= yearOfBirth; } // this will show Person's prototype property. console.log(Person.prototype); </script>

Q What is let and const? How both are different from var?
Answer:
1. In JavaScript when we were declaring any variable using var keyword.
2. Var keyword is function scoped.
29
3. We can access the variable within a function. This leads to wrap the code in a function whenever we had to create a new scope.
4. Let and const both are blocks scoped. If you declare a variable using these keywords then it only exists within the innermost block that surrounds them. Suppose you declare a variable us-ing let inside a block (if a condition or for-loop) then it will be accessed only within a block.
Below is an example of the let keyword if(true) { let a=0; console.log(a); //prints 0; } console.log(a); throws ReferenceError: a is not defined.
5. Const is immutable in JavaScript. You cannot change or reassign its value once it is declared. const a=0; a=1; // TypeError: Assignment to constatnt variable. const b= [1, 2]; b.push(3); //[1, 2, 3] b[3]= 4; // [1, 2, 3, 4]
Q What is set?
Answer:
1. Set is the collection of new values.
2. In Set, there shouldn’t be any duplicate value.
3. All the values should be unique.
4. These values can be primitive types or object references.
var mySet = new Set(); mySet.add(1); // Set [1] mySet.add(5); // Set [1, 5] mySet.add(5); // Set [1, 5] --ignored
Q What is the Generator function?
Answer:
1. This is a new feature in ES6.
2. Generator function allows you to generate many values over time, returning an object.
3. We can iterate this object, and we can pull values from the function one value at a time.
4. When you call a generator function it returns an iterable object.
5. We use * sign for a generator function with a new ‘yield’ keyword in ES6.
30
function *infiniteNumbers() { let n=1; while(true) { yield n++; } } const numbers = infiniteNumbers(); // returns an iterable object numbers.next(); // { value: 1, done: false} numbers.next(); // { value: 2, done: false} numbers.next(); // { value: 3, done: false}
Q What is the spread operator in ES6?
Answer:
1. Spread operator is used to obtain the list of parameters.
2. It is represented by three dots (…).
3. Basically, spread operator takes an iterable (such as array or string) and expands it into individual elements.
4. In JavaScript, it is mainly used to make shallow copies of JS.
5. It makes your code concise and increases the readability of your code.
6. You can use the spread operator to combine or to perform the concatenation between arrays. An example is given below let num1 = [40,50,60]; let num2 = [10,20,30,...num1,70,80,90,100]; console.log(num2); Q What is Destructuring in ES6?
Answer:
1. In ES6 destructuring was introduced to extract data from arrays and objects into an individual var-iable.
2. It allows you to extract the smaller fragment from objects and arrays. An example is given below let fullname =['Alan','Rickman']; let [fname,lname] = fullname; console.log (fname,lname);
31
Q Define Map in ES6.
Answer:
1. Before the ES6 was introduced we were using an object to map the keys and values.
2. Map becomes a new way in ES6 to represent the data in key-value pairs.
3. Map is ordered, and it remembers the insertion order of the keys.
4. we can traverse the elements in their insertion order.
Below is the representation of Map var map = new Map([iterable]);
a. Q What is callback and callback hell in JavaScript
Answer:
1. In the callback, a function gets executed after the completion of another function. In JavaScript callback is helpful in working with events. We pass a function into another function as an argu-ment to another function.
2. When we use callback in our web application, a lot of times happens that callback becomes nested. Excessive use of callbacks makes your web application messy and results in callback hell.

Q What is hoisting?
Answer:
1) Reference: https://www.interviewbit.com/javascript-cheat-sheet/
2) https://www.interviewbit.com/es6-interview-questions/
3) Hoisting is a default JavaScript behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the current scope (top of the current script or top of the current function).
4) The following code is an example of hoisting. console.log("Value of x: " + x); var y = x + 10; console.log("Added 10 to x and assigned it to y. So y = " + y); // now declaring x and assigning value var x = 10; Output:
32
Value of x: 10 Added 10 to x and assigned it to y. So y = 20 Q What are the different ways of creating an array in JavaScript?
Answer:
1) We can create arrays in JavaScript in the following three ways.
• Array literal
• Instance of Array
• Array constructor
2) Array literal: In the following example we are creating an array having three elements using array literal approach. var arr = [1, 2, 3];
3) Instance of Array: In the following example we are creating an array having three elements by instantiating Array. var arr = new Array(); arr[0] = 1; arr[1] = 2; arr[2] = 3;
4) Array constructor: In the following example we are creating an array having three elements us-ing array constructor. var arr = new Array(1, 2, 3);
Q What is setTimeout in JavaScript?
Answer:
a. The setTimeout function executes a function after a given delay.
b. In the following example we will get "Hello World" message in the browser console after 5000ms (milliseconds) delay. setTimeout(function() { console.log('Hello World'); }, 5000) • What is setInterval in JavaScript?
Answer:
33
1. The setInterval function is used to execute a function repeatedly after a given delay. The execu-tion stops only when we stop the timer using the clearInterval function.
2. In the following example we will get "Hello World" after every 3 seconds (3000ms) for 5 times. var count = 0; var t = setInterval(function() { console.log('Hello World'); count++; if (count === 5) { clearInterval(t); console.log('End'); } }, 3000);
• What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
Answer:
1. ViewState: It is specific to a single page in a session.
2. SessionState: It is user specific that can access all the data in the webpages.
• What is the use of Void(0) in javascript ?
Answer:
1. Void(0) is used to prevent a page from refreshing when used with hyperlinks.
2. In the following example we have a hyperlink which when clicked will not refresh the page or jump to the top of the page. <a href="javascript:void(0);" ondblclick="alert('Hello World')">Double click me</a>
Q What is Rest and spread operator?
Answer:
• In Javascript both spread operator and rest parameter have the same syntax which is three dots(…). Even though they have the same syntax they differ in functions.
• Spread operator: The spread operator helps us expand an iterable such as an array where multi-ple arguments are needed, it also helps to expand the object expressions. In cases where we re-quire all the elements of an iterable or object to help us achieve a task, we use a spread operator.
Syntax:
34
var var_name = [...iterable];
Example: <script> var array1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; var array2 = [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]; var array3 = [...array1, ...array2]; console.log(array3); </script>
Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
• Rest operator: The rest parameter is converse to the spread operator. while spread operator ex-pands elements of an iterable, rest operator compresses them. It collects several elements. In functions when we require to pass arguments but were not sure how many we have to pass, the rest parameter makes it easier.
Syntax: function function_name(...arguments) { statements; }
Example 4:
In this example, rest parameter condensing multiple elements into a single element even when different numbers of parameters are passed into the function, the function works as we used the rest parameter. it takes multiple elements as arguments and compresses them into a single ele-ment or iterable. further operations are performed on the iterable.
<script> function average(...args) { console.log(args); var avg = args.reduce(function (a, b) { return a + b; }, 0) / args.length; return avg; }
35
console.log("average of numbers is : " + average(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); console.log("average of numbers is : " + average(1, 2, 3)); </script>
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] "average of numbers is : 3" [1, 2, 3] "average of numbers is : 2"
Q What are global variables in JavaScript?
Answer:
• Global variables are the variables that are available throughout the code.
• If we create a variable without the var keyword then it becomes a global variable.
Q What is this keyword in JavaScript?
Answer:
• this keyword is used to refer to the object from where it is called.
Q What is the use of "use strict"; in JavaScript?
Answer:
• The "use strict"; in JavaScript is used to execute the code in strict mode.
• So, for example in strict mode we can't use undeclared variables.
• "use strict"; is a literal expression and not a statement and is ignored by older JavaScript versions.
Q How many ways an HTML element can be accessed in a JavaScript code?
Answer:
There are four possible ways to access HTML element in JavaScript which are:
• getElementById() Method: It is used to get the element by its id name.
• getElementsByClass() Method: It is used to get all the elements that have the given classname.
• getElementsByTagName() Method: It is used to get all the elements that have the given tag name.
36
• querySelector() Method: This function takes css style selector and returns the first selected ele-ment. How to Use the filter(), map() and reduce() Functions in JavaScript
Answer:
• map(), filter() and reduce() are three functions that facilitate our operations on arrays.
1. Filter() Function
• The filter() method accepts a callback function and returns a new array.
• * The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
• * The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
• * The filter() method does not change the original array.
• In short, if we want to filter on an array, we can use filter() function.
Syntax filter((element) => { /* ... */ } )
Example let array = [{id:5},{id:100}, {id:66},{id:400}]; let result = array.filter(item=>item.id>65); console.log(result);
2. Map() Function
• We use the map() function to reconstruct an array in the format as we want.
• Map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
• Map() calls a function once for each element in an array.
• Map() does not execute the function for empty elements.
• Map() does not change the original array.
• The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided func-tion on every element in the calling array.
Syntax: map((element) => { /* ... */ })
Example: let array = [{id:5},{id:100}, {id:66},{id:400}]; let result = array.filter(item=>item.id>65).map(item=>{ return { mapId:item.id ,mapName: item.name}}); console.log(result);
37
3. Reduce Function
• The purpose of the reduce() function is to reduce all elements of the original array into single by the primitive value or object value.
• The Reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element.
• The Reduce() method returns a single value: the function's accumulated result.
• The Reduce() method does not execute the function for empty array elements.
• The Reduce() method does not change the original array.
• The reduce() method executes a user-supplied “reducer” callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
Syntax: reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => { /* ... */ } )
Example: let array = [{id:5, name:”sarfaraz”},{id:100, name:”hussain”}, {id:66, name:”chaudhary”},{id:400, name:”kamran”}]; let result = array.reduce((item,sum)=>sum+item.id,0); console.log(result);
CSS Q What is CSS Box Model?
Answer:
1. The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model.
2. Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below:
38
3. Border Area: It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of the border.
4. Margin Area: This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of the Margin area are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to sepa-rate the element from its neighbors.
5. Padding Area: It includes the element’s padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and within the border box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.
6. Content Area: This area consists of content like text, images, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height. Q Can we add an image as a list item marker?
Answer:
1. To add an image as the list-item marker in a list, we use the list-style-image property in CSS.
Syntax: list-style-image: none | url | initial | inherit; Q What is the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden?
Answer:
Both of the property is quite useful in CSS. The visibility: “hidden”; property is used to spec-ify whether an element is visible or not in a web document but the hidden elements take up space in the web document. The visibility is a property in CSS that specifies the visibility behavior of an ele-ment and display: “none” property is used to specify whether an element is exist or not on the web-site.
Syntax:
1) Visibility property: visibility: visible| hidden | collapse | initial | inherit;
39
2) Visibility property: display: none | inline | block | inline-block;
So, the difference between display: “none”; and visibility: “hidden”;, right from the name itself we can tell the difference as display: “none”, completely gets rids of the tag, as it had never existed in the HTML page whereas visibility: “hidden”;, just makes the tag invisible it will still be on the HTML page occupying space it’s just invisible.
Q Can we overlap elements in CSS?
Answer:
Creating an overlay effect simply means putting two div together at the same place but both the div appear when needed i.e while hovering or while clicking on one of the div to make the second one appears. Overlays are very clean and give the webpage a tidy look. It looks sophisticated and is simple to design. Overlays can create using two simple CSS properties:
The z-index property is used to displace elements on the z-axis i.e in or out of the screen. It is used to define the order of elements if they overlap with each other.
Syntax: z-index: auto|number|initial|inherit;
Q What are the various positioning properties in CSS?
Answer:
The position property in CSS talks about the method of positioning for an element or an HTML en-tity. There are five different types of position properties available in CSS:
(1) Fixed (2) Static (3) Relative (4) Absolute (5) Sticky
The positioning of an element can be done using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. These specify the distance of an HTML element from the edge of the viewport. To set the position by these four properties, we have to declare the positioning method.
Let’s talk about each of these position methods in detail:
1. Fixed: Any HTML element with position: fixed property will be positioned relative to the viewport. An element with fixed positioning allows it to remain at the same position even as we scroll the page. We can set the position of the element using the top, right, bottom, and left.
2. Static: This method of positioning is set by default. If we don’t mention the method of positioning for any element, the element has the position: static method by default. By defining Static, the top, right, bottom and left will not have any control over the element. The element will be positioned with the normal flow of the page.
40
3. Relative: An element with position: relative is positioned relatively with the other elements which are sitting at top of it. If we set its top, right, bottom, or left, other elements will not fill up the gap left by this element.
4. Absolute: An element with position: absolute will be positioned with respect to its parent. The po-sitioning of this element does not depend upon its siblings or the elements which are at the same level.
5. Sticky: Element with position: sticky and top: 0 played a role between fixed & relative based on the position where it is placed. If the element is placed in the middle of the document, then when the user scrolls the document, the sticky element starts scrolling until it touches the top. When it touches the top, it will be fixed at that place in spite of further scrolling. We can stick the element at the bottom, with the bottom property.
Q What is CSS overflow?
Answer:
The CSS overflow controls the big content. It tells whether to clip content or to add scroll bars. The overflow contains the following property:
1) Visible (2) hidden (3) scroll (4) auto
1. Visible: The content is not clipped and is visible outside the element box.
2. Hidden: The overflow is clipped and the rest of the content is invisible.
3. Scroll: The overflow is clipped but a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content. The scrollbar can be horizontal or vertical.
4. Auto: It automatically adds a scrollbar whenever it is required.
Overflow-x and Overflow-y: This property specifies how to change the overflow of ele-ments. x deals with horizontal edges and y deals with vertical edges.
Q What does the CSS float property do?
Answer:
Float is a CSS property written in a CSS file or directly in the style of an element. The float property defines the flow of content. Below are the types of floating properties: float: left Element floats on the left side of the container float: right Element floats on the right side of the container float: inherit The element inherits the floating property of its parent (div, table, etc…) float: none Element is displayed as it is (Default).
41
Q What does display:inline-block do?
Answer:
Inline-block: This feature uses both properties: block and inline. So, this property aligns the div inline but the difference is it can edit the height and the width of the block. Basically, this will align the div both in the block and inline fashion. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>CSS | Display property</title> <style> #main{ height: 100px; width: 200px; background: teal; display: inline-block; } #main1{ height: 100px; width: 200px; background: cyan; display: inline-block; } #main2{ height: 100px; width: 200px; background: green; display: inline-block; } .gfg { margin-left:200px; font-size:42px;
42
font-weight:bold; color:#009900; } .geeks { font-size:25px; margin-left:210px; } .main { margin:50px; } </style> </head> <body> <div class = "gfg">GeeksforGeeks</div> <div class = "geeks">display: Inline-block; property</div> <div class = "main"> <div id="main"> BLOCK 1 </div> <div id="main1"> BLOCK 2</div> <div id="main2">BLOCK 3 </div> </div> </body> </html>
Q How can we vertically center a text in CSS?
Answer:
This solution will work for a single line and multiple lines of text, but it still requires a fixed height container: div { height: 200px; line-height: 200px; text-align: center; border: 2px dashed #f69c55; }
43
span { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; line-height: normal; } div{ SampleDivForSarfaraz } Q What are CSS transitions?
Answer:
1) Transitions in CSS allow us to control the way in which transition takes place between the two states of the element.
2) The transition allows us to determine how the change in color takes place. We can use the transitions to animate the changes and make the changes visually appealing to the user and hence, giving a better user experience and interactivity. In this article, we will show you how to animate the transition between the CSS properties.
3) There are four CSS properties that you should use, all or in part (at least two, transition-property and transition-duration, is a must), to animate the transition. All these properties must be placed along with other CSS properties of the initial state of the element:
4) transition-property: This property allows you to select the CSS properties which you want to animate during the transition(change).
Syntax:
transition-property: none | all | property | property1,property2, ..., propertyN;
5) transition-duration: This property allows you to determine how long it will take to com-plete the transition from one CSS property to the other.
Syntax: transition-duration: time;
6) Here, time can be in seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms), you should use ‘s’ or ‘ms’ after the number (without quotes).
7) transition-timing-function: This property allows you to determine the speed of change and the manner of change, during the transition. Like, the change should be fast at the beginning and slow at the end, etc.
44
Syntax: transition-timing-function: ease | ease-in|ease-out | ease-in-out|linear | step-start | step-end;
8) transition-delay: This property allows you to determine the amount of time to wait be-fore the transition actually starts to take place.
Syntax: transition-delay: time;
9) Here, again, time can be in seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms), and you should use ‘s’ or ‘ms’ after the number (without quotes).
1. How can we animate using CSS?
Answer:
CSS Animations is a technique to change the appearance and behavior of various elements in web pages. It is used to control the elements by changing their motions or display. It has two parts, one which contains the CSS properties which describe the animation of the elements and the other contains certain keyframes which indicate the animation properties of the element and the specific time intervals at which those have to occur.
The @keyframes rule: Keyframes are the foundations with the help of which CSS Animations works. They define the display of the animation at the respective stages of its whole duration. For example: In the following code, the paragraph changes its color with time. At 0% completion, it is red, at 50% completion it is of orange color and at full completion i.e. at 100%, it is brown.
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> #profile { animation-name: color; animation-duration: 25s; padding-top:30px; padding-bottom:30px; font-family:Times New Roman; } #name { font-size: 40px; text-align:center;
45
font-weight:bold; color:#090; padding-bottom:5px; } #developer { font-size:17px; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; } @keyframes color { 0% { background-color: red; } 50% { background-color: orange; } 100% { background-color: brown; } } </style> </head> <body> <div id = "profile"> <div id = "name">SarfarazHussain</div> <div id = "developer">React Developer</div> </div> </body> </html>
2. What does the CSS box-sizing property do?
Answer:
46
The box-sizing CSS property defines how the user should calculate the total width and height of an element i.e. padding and borders, are to be included or not.
Syntax:
box-sizing: content-box|border-box;
Property Values:
content-box: This is the default value of the box-sizing property. In this mode, the width and height properties include only the content. Border and padding are not included in it i.e if we set an element’s width to 200 pixels, then the element’s content box will be 200 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width.
border-box: In this mode, the width and height properties include content, padding, and borders i.e if we set an element’s width to 200 pixels, that 200 pixels will include any border or padding we added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much easier to size elements. 3. What is CSS flexbox?
Answer:
It is also called a flexible box model. It is basically a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container. Flexbox is different from the block model which is verti-cally biased and the inline which is horizontally biased. Flexbox was created for small-scale layouts and there’s another standard called grids which are geared more towards larger-scale layouts, It works similar to the way to Twitter bootstrap grid system works. Flexbox is responsive and mo-bile-friendly. To start with flexbox firstly create a flex container. To create a flex container set the display property to flex.
Syntax:
.main-container { display: flex; }
Flex Properties:
• flex-direction
• flex-wrap
• flex-flow
• justify-content
• align-items
• align-content

4. What is CSS Grid?
Answer:
It is a CSS property that offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without floats and positioning.
Syntax: grid: none|grid-template-rows / grid-template-columns|grid-template-areas| grid-template-rows / [grid-auto-flow] grid-auto-columns|[grid-auto-flow] grid-auto-rows / grid-template-columns|initial|inherit; 5. What is the difference between flexbox and grid?
Answer:
1) Dimensionality and Flexibility:
1) Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items. Be-ing one-dimensional, Flexbox only deals with either columns or rows.
2) The grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible widths as a unit of length. This compensates for the limitations in Flex.
2) Alignment:
1) Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, which is used when developers create and reverse rows or columns.
2) CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns or rows.
3) Item Management
1) Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. The Flex Container can ensure balanced representation by adjusting item dimensions. This allows developers to design for fluctuating screen sizes.
2) Grid supports both implicit and explicit content placement. Its inbuilt automation allows it to automatically extend line items and copy values into the new creation from the pre-ceding item.

6. What is specificity in CSS?
Answer:
When more than one set of CSS rules applies to the same element, the browser will have to de-cide which specific set will be applied to the element. The rules the browser follows are collec-tively called Specificity
Specificity Rules include:
1. CSS style applied by referencing external stylesheet has the lowest precedence and is overridden by Internal and inline CSS.
2. Internal CSS is overridden by inline CSS.
3. Inline CSS has the highest priority and overrides all other selectors.
Specificity Hierarchy: Every element selector has a position in the Hierarchy.
Inline style: Inline style has the highest priority.
Identifiers(ID): ID has the second-highest priority.
Classes, pseudo-classes, and attributes: Classes, pseudo-classes, and attributes have come next.
Elements and pseudo-elements: Elements and pseudo-elements have the lowest priority. 7. What does CSS Animations allow?
Answer:
CSS allows the animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript. An animation lets an ele-ment systematically and with proper timing, change from one style to another. You can change whatever CSS properties you want, and end a number of times, as you want it. To use CSS anima-tion, you must first specify some @keyframes for the animation. @keyframes will describe which styles that element will have at specific times. We will be using a basic example such as the ani-mation of a battery charging.
The @keyframes property has the option to divide the animation time into parts/percentage and perform an activity that is specified for that part of the whole duration of the animation. The
49
@keyframes property is given to each animation according to the name of that animation. It al-lows you to run the animation infinitely as well.
HTML 8. What are new features in HTML5?
Answer:
1. It has Multimedia Support.
2. It has the capabilities to store offline data using SQL databases and application cache.
3. Javascript can be run in the background.
4. HTML5 also allows users to draw various shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.
5. Included new Semantic tags and form control tags.
9. What is webstorage in HTML5?
Answer:
1. This web storage helps in storing some of the static data in the local storage of the browser so that we do not need to fetch it from the server every time we need it. There is a size limit based on different browsers. This helps in decreasing the load time and a smooth user experience. There are two types of web storage that are used to store data locally in HTML5:
1. Local Storage - This helps in storing data that will be retained even though the user reo-pens the browser. It is stored for each webapp on different browsers.
2. Session Storage - This is used for one session only. After the user closes the browser this gets deleted.
10. What is the usage of a novalidate attribute for the form tag that is introduced in HTML5?
Answer:
Its value is a boolean type that indicates whether or not the data being submitted by the form will be validated beforehand. By making this false, forms can be submitted without validation which helps users to resume later also. <form action = "" method = "get" novalidate> Name:<br><input type="name" name="sname"><br> Doubt:<br><input type="number" name="doubt"><br> <input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form>
50
11. What is the Geolocation API in HTML5?
Answer:
Geolocation API is used to share the physical location of the client with websites. This helps in serv-ing locale-based content and a unique experience to the user, based on their location. This works with a new property of the global navigator object and most of the modern browsers support this var geolocation = navigator.geolocation;
12. What are the frequently useful API in HTML5?
Answer:
1. Media API
2. Data Transfer API
3. Application Cache API
4. User Interaction
5. History API
6. Constraint Validation API
7. Command API
8. Text Track API
13. Explain Meta tags.
Answer:
Meta tags are used to provide useful information to our web pages.
Some of the tags include:
Title: Provides a title to the web page.
Style: Inserts some styles and CSS details to the web page.
Link: Defines the relationship between one page to another page and an external source. 14. What are semantic elements?
Answer:
Semantic elements are those which describe the particular meaning to the browser and the developer. Elements like <form>, <table>, <article>, <figure>, etc., are semantic elements.
15. What is the difference between <meter> tag and <progress> tag?
Answer:
<progress> tag should be used when we want to show the completion progress of a task, whereas if we just want a scalar measurement within a known range or fraction value. Also, we can specify multiple extra attributes for <meter> tags like ‘form’, ‘low’, ‘high’, ‘min’, etc.
51
16. How to Create "Back to top" link to jump to the top of the page in HTML?
Answer:
1. To solve this, we will first create an anchor tag a at the beginning of the page ideally close to the body tag. And we will set the name attribute of the anchor tag to let’s say back-to-top.
<a name="back-to-top"></a>
2. Now we create another anchor tag in the page from where we want to jump back to the top of the page and we set the href attribute to #back-to-top.
<a href="#back-to-top">Back to top</a>
3. Now if the user clicks the Back to top link the page will scroll back to the top of the page.
17. What is the difference between Block and Inline elements?
Answer:
1. Block element always starts from a new line and takes up the entire width available.
2. Inline elements don't start from a new line and takes up only necessary width.
3. Some of the block elements are listed below: div, form, p, table
4. Some of the inline elements are listed below: span, a, sup, sub
React Q What are advantages of React hooks?
Answer:
React hooks are functions that let you hook into react state and life-cycle features from function components. React provides built-in hooks like useState, useEffect, useReducer, us-eRef, useCallback, useContext, useMemo and you can also create you own custom hooks.
React hooks are available from react version of 16.8. Before the introduction of hooks, state can be maintained only in class component not in functional component, after the introduc-tion of hooks, state can be maintained in functional component also.
Advantages of react hooks over class component:
1. The main advantage of react hooks is the re-usability of stateful logic. It can be done with the help of custom hooks. Without changing component hierarchy, you can reuse stateful logic and it is easy to share custom hooks with other components.
2. In react class component, we split our work in different life-cycle methods like
componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount, but in hooks, we can do everything in a single hook called useEffect.
3. In class component, we have to use this keyword and also we have to bind event
listeners, which increases complexity. This is prevented in react functional components.
52
4. React class components don’t minify very well, and they make hot reloading flaky and unreliable.
5. React hooks are easier to test and work with, makes the code look cleaner, easier to read and has less number of lines of code.
useState Hook:
1. useState hook is used to add state to a functional component. const [blogName, setBlogName] = useState('React'); <button onClick={() => setBlogName('React Hooks')}>Change </button>
2. In the above snippet, the initial value of the blogName state variable is ‘React’. Using set-BlogName setter function, you can change the value of the blogName state variable.
53
3. useEffect Hook : In class component , when the document title has to be based on coun-ter state value, and when the document title has to updated whenever the counter value changes, we use the following code. componentDidMount() { document.title =`Clicked ${this.state.count} times`; } componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { if(prevProps.count !== this.count){ document.title = `Clicked ${this.state.count} times` } }
4. In the above code snippet, the codes inside componentDidMount and
componentDidUpdate are relatable, but they are written in two different methods. To overcome this, we can use useEffect hook. useEffect(() { document.title =`You Clicked ${count} times`; }, [count])
5. The above useEffect hook gets executed after every component render and whenever the count changes, it will be executed again. You can have multiple useEffect hooks in a single component, where you write relatable code inside each.
6. Custom Hooks: Custom hooks is a easy way to re-use stateful logic in react hooks. import {useState} from ‘react’ function useInput(initialValue) { const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue) const reset = () => { setValue('') } const bind = { value, onChange: e => { setValue(e.target.value)
54
} } return [value, bind, reset] }
7. The above snippet is an example of a custom form hook, it accepts the initial value as props and sends the initial value, setter function and reset function. const [firstName, bindFirstName, resetFirstName] = useInput(""); const [lastName, bindLastName, resetLastName] = useInput(""); // You have to use the below lines inside form <input type="text" {...bindFirstName} /> <input type="text" {...bindLastName} />
8. You can import useInput custom hook in your component and you can use it in your component like this.
9. inshort: React hooks don’t replace your knowledge of react concepts. Instead, hooks pro-vide a more direct way to use react concepts which you already know.
Q What is getDerivedStateFromProps?
Answer:
This method is called before the rendering or before any updation of the component. This method is majorly used to update the state, before the rendering of the component, which depends upon the props received by the component. Syntax: static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
In this example, we will build a React application which will fetch the list of users and on clicking the 'fetch user' button, the Show component will get placed in the DOM and before rendering this compo-nent, getDerivedStateFromProps method is called which updates the state according to the props passed to it.
import React from 'react'; class App extends React.Component { constructor() { super();
55
this.state = { show: false, }; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>User List</h1> <h3>Username: Rahul</h3> <button onClick={() => this.setState({ show: true })}> Fetch Users </button> {this.state.show ? <Show email="qwerty@gmail.com" /> : null} </div> ); } } class Show extends React.Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = { email: '', }; } static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) { console.log('getDerivedStateFromProps method is called'); return { email: props.email }; } render() { return (
56
<div> <h3>Email: {this.state.email}</h3> </div> ); } } export default App; Q What are the limitations of React?
Answer:
1. The high pace of development
2. Poor Documentation
3. View Part: It is a UI library only
4. JSX as a barrier
5. Problems with SEO
6. In React, some standard functions will not able to use state effectively instead of that we go for the use of ES6.
Q What is React Life methods?
5. ComponentWillMount: deprecated in 2018, used before the component is rendered, api call at run time used, used rarely
6. ComponentDidMount: when component is mounted to DOM, Used in ajax call.
7. ComponentWillRecieveProps: Run every time, when it receives the props.
8. ShouldComponentUpdate: It tells react, should component, render or not
9. ComponentDidUpdate: When New component is updated in the DOM
10. ComponentWillUnmount: Called before unmounting the component from DOM
Q What are the major features of React?
Answer:
11. It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
12. Supports server-side rendering.
13. Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
14. Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.
57
Q When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?
Answer:
If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then use class component otherwise use func-tion component. However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component. *So, it is always recommended to use Function components, unless you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries *
15. Reference: https://www.interviewbit.com/react-interview-questions/ Q What is React Hooks? What are the different Hooks you used in your project?
Answer:
Hooks is a special function (introduced as a new feature in React 16.8) that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.
Let's see an example of useState hook: import { useState } from 'react'; function Example() { // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count" const [count, setCount] = useState(0); return ( <div> <p>You clicked {count} times</p> <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> Click me </button> </div> ); }
58
Q What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?
Answer:
Below are the main differences between Real DOM and Virtual DOM, Real DOM Virtual DOM Updates are slow Updates are fast DOM manipulation is very expensive. DOM manipulation is very easy You can update HTML directly. You Can’t directly update HTML It causes too much of memory wastage There is no memory wastage Creates a new DOM if element updates It updates the JSX if element update
Q What is the difference between state and props?
Answer:
Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influ-ences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.
Q What are synthetic events in React?
Answer:
SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers. Q What is the difference between context API and Redux?
Answer:
we can use Context in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for.
59
Whereas Redux is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context API doesn't provide. Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API.
Q What is React memo function?
Answer:
Class components can be restricted from re-rendering when their input props are the same using PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate. Now you can do the same with func-tion components by wrapping them in React.memo. const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) { /* only rerenders if props change */ });
Q What is React lazy function?
Answer:
The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. It will automati-cally load the bundle containing the OtherComponent when the component gets rendered. This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React compo-nent. const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent')); function MyComponent() { return ( <div> <OtherComponent /> </div> ); }
Note: React.lazy and Suspense is not yet available for server-side rendering. If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, we still recommend React Loadable.
